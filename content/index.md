# Hello!

I'm a passionate Software Engineer from
[Kozhikode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozhikode),
[Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) now living in London, UK. I like
to take an idea, conceptualize it and make it a reality with focus on
simplicity.

Currently, I work as a Principal Engineer at [Funding Circle
UK](https://fundingcircle.com/uk/). I take care of Data Reliability Engineering,
orchestration, tooling around democratising data platform for wider use and
adoption in the company. Previously, I've worked with
[Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/en-gb/),
[Expedia](https://www.expedia.co.uk/), [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com/),
Collective, and [JMR Infotech](https://jmrinfotech.com/).

[Clojure](https://clojure.org)([Script](https://clojurescript.org)),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are my top three programming
languages and I prefer functional programming to other programming paradigms.
However, I also work with Javascript, Python, Go, Java, Scala, Terraform, Cloud
Formation and other technologies whichever fits the problem domain. I have been
using Dvorak keyboard layout and emacs ([Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org/))
since 2013. I have an M.Sc in [E-Business & Information
Systems](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/e-business-information-systems-msc/)
from [University of Newcastle upon Tyne](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) in year
2011-2012.
