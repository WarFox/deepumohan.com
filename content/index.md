<HeroSection>Hello!</HeroSection>

I am a well-rounded polyglot generalist software engineer living in
London, UK. I like to take an idea, conceptualize it and make it a
reality with focus on simplicity.

I work as a Principal Engineer at [Funding Circle
UK](https://fundingcircle.com/uk/). Here I enjoy building the Data
Platform and improving user experience for developing data products
and help create value from data. Previously, I've worked with
[Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/en-gb/),
[Expedia](https://www.expedia.co.uk/),
[Kainos](https://www.kainos.com/), Collective, and [JMR
Infotech](https://jmrinfotech.com/).

My experience spans Software Engineering, Data Platform and
Engineering, Event-Driven Systems, Infrastructure management, RESTful
services/APIs, full-stack applications, as well as system design and
architecture.

[Clojure](https://clojure.org)([Script](https://clojurescript.org)),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are my top three
programming languages and I prefer functional programming to other
programming paradigms.  However, I also work with Javascript, Python,
Go, Java, Scala, Terraform, Cloud Formation and other technologies
whichever fits the problem domain. I have been using Dvorak keyboard
layout and emacs ([Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/))
since 2013.

I have an M.Sc in [E-Business & Information
Systems](https://ebusiness.ncl.ac.uk/news/ebusiness/master-ebusiness-information-systems/5/)
from [University of Newcastle upon Tyne](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) in
year 2011-2012. I am originally from Kozhikode, Kerala, India.
