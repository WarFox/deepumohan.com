# Hello

## My name is Deepu Mohan Puthrote

I'm a passionate Software Engineer from
[Kozhikode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozhikode),
[Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) now living in London, UK. I like
to take an idea, conceptualize it and make it a reality with focus on
simplicity. I find Data Engineering, DevOps, and DataOps challenges to be
particularly interesting.

My skills include <TypeEffect/>

Currently, I'm Senior Data Platform Engineer at [Funding Circle
UK](https://fundingcircle.com/uk/). Previously, I've worked with
[Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/en-gb/),
[Expedia](https://www.expedia.co.uk/), [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com/),
Collective, and [JMR Infotech](https://jmrinfotech.com/).

[Clojure](https://clojure.org)([Script](https://clojurescript.org)) is my
favourite programming language and I prefer functional programming to other
programming paradigms. However, I also work on Javascript, Typescript, Python,
Java, Scala, Terraform and other technologies whichever fits the problem domain.
